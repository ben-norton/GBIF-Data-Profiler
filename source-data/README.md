All occurrence datasets are placed in this directory and inventoried using a source-data-inventory.md file. 

Notes
1. A source-data-inventory.md template is located in the project-docs template directory. Please make a copy of the template and place it in this directory. 
2. The contents of this folder are ignored except for the example dataset (see below).
3. Downloaded archive should be extracted to folders. Each folder should be named according to the package ID.

Please see the Project Documentation README file located in the project-docs directory.
